# PizzaParty
Hackathon Project for GrizzHacks 2019

PizzaParty is a mobile app directed towards party planners that tackles the problem of managing topping preferences and dietary restrictions. The party admin can create a party and provide 'prefab' pizzas. Party participants can join parties and choose how many of each pizza they want. We then optimize and find the best way we can order a pizza to satisfy as many people as possible, using a clever greedy algorithm.
